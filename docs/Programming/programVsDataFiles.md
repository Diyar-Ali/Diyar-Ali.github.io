The main difference between **program files** and **data files** lies in their purpose and how they are used by a computer:

### 1. **Program Files**
- **Definition**: These are files that contain instructions or code that can be executed by a computer to perform specific tasks.
- **Purpose**: Used to run software or applications.
- **Examples**: 
  - Executable files like `.exe` or `.bin`
  - Scripts like `.py`, `.sh`, or `.bat`
  - Library files like `.dll` or `.so`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Typically static once installed, unless updated.
  - Interpreted or executed by a CPU or software interpreter.

### 2. **Data Files**
- **Definition**: These are files that store information or data used by programs, but they cannot be executed.
- **Purpose**: Contain input, output, or intermediate data used by programs.
- **Examples**:
  - Text files like `.txt` or `.csv`
  - Images, audio, or video files like `.jpg`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`
  - Database files like `.db` or `.sql`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Created, modified, or read by users or programs.
  - Serve as the working or storage data for applications.

### Example in Action:
- A word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word):
  - **Program File**: The executable file (`winword.exe`) used to run the application.
  - **Data File**: The document files you create and save, like `.docx` or `.txt`.
