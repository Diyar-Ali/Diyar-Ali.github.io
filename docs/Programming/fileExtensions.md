### **What Are File Extensions?**
A **file extension** is a suffix at the end of a file name, typically separated by a period (`.`), that indicates the file's format and the type of data it contains. For example:
- `document.txt` has the extension `.txt`
- `photo.jpg` has the extension `.jpg`

### **Function of File Extensions**
File extensions serve two primary purposes:

1. **Identify the File Type**  
   They help the operating system and users understand the kind of data a file contains (e.g., text, image, video, etc.).  
   Examples:
   - `.txt` → Plain text file  
   - `.png` → Image file  
   - `.mp4` → Video file  

2. **Associate a File with a Program**  
   The operating system uses file extensions to determine which application should open the file by default.  
   Examples:
   - `.docx` → Opens with Microsoft Word  
   - `.html` → Opens with a browser or text editor  
   - `.exe` → Executed by the operating system as a program  

### **How File Extensions Work**
- **When Saving**: Applications automatically add the appropriate extension (e.g., a photo editor saves images as `.jpg` or `.png`).
- **When Opening**: The operating system looks at the extension and selects the default program to open it.

### **Common File Extensions by Category**
1. **Documents**: `.txt`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.csv`  
2. **Images**: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`  
3. **Audio**: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aac`  
4. **Video**: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv`  
5. **Compressed Files**: `.zip`, `.rar`, `.tar`  
6. **Program/Executable Files**: `.exe`, `.bat`, `.sh`, `.py`  
7. **Code Files**: `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.c`, `.java`

### **Can a File Work Without an Extension?**
- Yes, a file can function without an extension, but the operating system may not automatically know how to open it. In such cases, users or programs must manually specify the application to open the file.
