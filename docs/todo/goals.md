Okay! Imagine you have two toy boxes: one for **cars** and one for **drivers**. Each driver is matched with a car, and you want to know:

- For a car: *"Who is the driver?"*
- For a driver: *"Which car do they drive?"*

In Django, the **`related_name`** is like giving a nickname to help find the drivers when you start with the car.

### Example:
- If you name the relationship **"car_drivers"**, you can say: *"Hey car, who are your drivers?"*
- Without the nickname, it might be hard to ask that question.

So, **`related_name`** is just a shortcut name to make it easy to ask about the connection in the other direction! ðŸ˜Š
